# Project Overview

This project, `PortfolioCircuit_Static`, appears to be a static website. 

## Key Files and Directories:

- `index.html`, `index2.html`: Main HTML files, likely representing different pages or versions of the website.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for interactive functionalities.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the website.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for deployment, indicating automated deployment setup.
- `attached_assets/`: Directory containing various image files (`.jpg`) and a PDF document (`.pdf`), likely used as content for the portfolio.
- `shapeshift/`: A subdirectory with its own `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`, possibly a sub-project or a distinct section of the portfolio.
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables file.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `README.md`: Project README file.

This structure suggests a client-side rendered portfolio website with a focus on visual content and potentially a separate interactive component or section within `shapeshift/`.
