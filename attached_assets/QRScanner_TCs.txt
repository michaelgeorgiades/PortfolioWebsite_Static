Privacy Policy for QRay

  Last Updated: 2025-12-02

  Thank you for using QRay ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and handled when you use our application.

  1. Information We Collect

  QRay is designed to be a private and secure utility. The app handles the following types of information:

   * QR Code Data: Any information you enter to create a QR code (such as website URLs, text, business card details, or Wi-Fi credentials) or any information decoded when you scan a QR code.
   * Scan History: The app stores a history of the last 20 QR codes you have scanned.

  All of the information listed above is stored locally on your device only. It is never transmitted, uploaded, or shared to any external servers or third parties by the App.

  2. How We Use Your Information

  The information handled by the App is used solely for the following purposes:

   * To generate QR codes based on the data you provide.
   * To display the information from a QR code you have scanned.
   * To store your recent scan history on your device for your convenience.
   * To automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network when you scan a valid Wi-Fi QR code.

  3. Data Storage and Security

  All data, including your scan history, is stored in the app's private directory on your device. The security of this data is dependent on the overall security of your mobile device. We do not implement any
  additional encryption on this data. Clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app will permanently delete this history.

  4. Permissions

  QRay requires the following permissions to function correctly:

   * Camera: This permission is required to allow the App to scan QR codes using your device's camera. The camera is only activated when you are on the "Scan" tab.
   * Location: This permission is required by the Android operating system to allow an app to scan for and connect to Wi-Fi networks. QRay does not collect, store, or transmit your location data. This
     permission is used only to facilitate the Wi-Fi connection feature.

  5. Third-Party Services

  QRay does not use any third-party services that would result in the sharing of your personal information. Any "Share" functionality within the app is initiated by you and uses your device's native sharing
  capabilities.

  6. Children's Privacy

  This App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13.

  7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
  changes.
